I want to create an app

- user post script

- backend side understand the given script and extract words and its related sentence in association.

- backend side make grouping of words based on difficulty levels

- backend side serve user word tests in Anki style (in first version, we don't need Anki style recursive tracking system. just show word tests based on the source user provided).

- on iOS app, user can see word test by 1 by 1 word manner. In each word page, first the app shows word and its associated sentence in the source. then, once user taps he/she memorizes it or not, the app shows it's meaning.

first, let's create the iOS app. please write a spec.
